Build a Search Engine

There are two Search Engines in the repository, the BaseLine and the Customized
The BaseLine Search Engine has the following characteristics:
  • For	each	file	in	the	collection,	all	of	the	text	is	indexed	as	a	single	field.		
  • The	Analyzer	used	during	index	and	search	is	the	Lucene.Net.Analysis.Simple	analyzer.		
  • The	index	does	not	save	information	related	to	field	normalisation.			
  • The	index	does	not	save	information	related	to	term	vectors.
  
  The Customized Search Engine houses customizations that aim to improve the performance of the Search Engine
  
  The performance of the two engines will be compared against each other in the evaluation part.
